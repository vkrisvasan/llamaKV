            "\n",
            "A2: Musk alludes to the risks of singularity, uncontrolled growth of AI power, and potentially catastrophic outcomes if AI surpasses human intelligence and becomes uncontrollable. He also warns about the risk of value misalignment, where AI's goals conflict with human values, leading to undesirable consequences. If these risks are not mitigated, it could lead to catastrophic outcomes such as AI taking control of critical infrastructure, irreversible damage to the environment, or even the extinction of the human species.\n",
